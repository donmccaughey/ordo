### On Gender

As mentioned in  [Allen and Greenough: Rules of Gender][1], Latin nouns are
classified into three primary genders: masculine "masculinum", feminine
"femininum", and neuter "neutrum".

Some words are categorized as _common gender_ "genus commune" or _either 
gender_ "genus utrumque"; these words can be either masculine or feminine based
on who or what they refer to.  "Bos", "canis", "civis" and "parens" are
examples.

Some words for animals are classified as _epicene_ ["epicoenus"][2] or 
[_promiscuous_][3] "promiscuum".  (While _promiscuous_ nowadays has a sexual
connotation, its older meaning is "made up of various disparate elements mixed 
together".)  In Latin, epicene words have a [fixed grammatical gender][4] but 
can refer to either males or females.  "Aquila" (f), "lepus" (m), "passer" (m),
and "vulpes" (f) are examples.

[William Lily][5] in his [_A Short Introduction of Grammar_][6] (circa 1540)
writes that there are seven genders: masculine, feminine, neuter, commune of
two, commune of three, doubtful and epicene.

For a good discussion, see this r/latin post: ["How many genders in Latin"][7].
